About Solar
===========

https://solar-lang.netlify.app/

The Solar programming language is a variant of the Lua programming language.

Just like Lua, Solar is a lightweight and high-level programming language. Solar has been adapted from Lua to accomodate elegant language design decisions in other popular languages, such as C++, Java, JavaScript and Python.

Usage
===========

A browser-based programming environment for Solar, along with a syntax cheatsheet, can be found at https://solar-lang.netlify.app/ .

Hence, please feel free to write and execute Solar programs there.
