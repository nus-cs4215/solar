About Solar
==============
The Solar programming language is an adaptation of the language [Lua (Ver 5.3)](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/).

Solar borrows heavily from the base syntax of Lua. However, there are divergences where we have introduced our own language design decisions, due to our take on programming language design.
